# Management-System-for-Smart-Homes

Final project for the Building AI course

## Background

Smart homes are becoming increasingly popular, but managing energy consumption in these homes can be a challenge. An AI-powered energy management system can help optimize energy consumption, reduce costs, and reduce the carbon footprint of a smart home. This project is important because it addresses the need for energy efficiency and sustainability in the home.

## Data and AI techniques

The project will depend on data such as appliance usage patterns, weather data, and occupancy information. AI techniques such as reinforcement learning, decision trees, and neural networks could be used to make predictions about energy consumption and optimize energy usage.

## How is it used?

The solution could be integrated into smart home systems and used by homeowners to manage their energy consumption.

## Challenges

The system may struggle to accurately predict energy consumption in homes with unique or unusual usage patterns. The system may also struggle to account for changes in occupancy or usage patterns over time.

## What next?

The project could be expanded to include additional data sources such as energy prices, renewable energy sources, and energy storage systems. The system could also be integrated into smart grid systems to provide a more comprehensive and integrated approach to energy management.
